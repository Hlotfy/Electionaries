## The social network for fact-based civil political discussion.

Navigating modern day elections to get a balanced view of different topics can be tricky. As articulated in “Bursting Your (Filter) Bubble: Strategies for Promoting Diverse Exposure,” social network sites can often create echo chambers for users, leading them to see content that reinforces their opinions, rather than different opinions to gain a broader perspective. The paper “The top five reasons for lurking: improving community experiences for everyone” explains that sites also have design features that may not promote an encouraging environment for users to interact and engage.

With the 2020 presidential election coming up, we designed a new social network site, Electionaries, that enables users to engage in political discussion in a fact-based and civil manner. The platform of engagement is the news articles themselves, and users comment through annotating sections that they have an opinion about. This encourages every comment to be fact-based. Additionally, these annotations are screened by our "Civility Algorithm," which continuously updates "Civility Scores" for users (similar to Uber ratings!), to promote civil and polite commentary and engagement. Electionaries will also provide users with the opportunity to view different news articles from various sites on both sides of the political spectrum to combat echo chambers, and also includes following features which help create a community experience around sharing fact-based, civil opinions on news.
